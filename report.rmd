# Human Activity Recognition

## Executive Summary

The purpose of the report is to describe the methodology used to produce a model that was
then applied to the training results of group of 20 individuals that resulted
in 100% success of predicting the training class used by each participant.
Applied machine learning techniques in R programming and gbm (generalized
boosted regression model) algorithm were used.

Model accuracy and estimated error was calculated in two ways: a 20% validation data 
split and a k-fold cross validation where k = 10. K-fold cross validation was
.9621 while the validation set was predicted at a rate of .9609.

## Description of Experiment

Using devices
such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a
large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. This
purpose of this experiment is to use data from accelerometers on the belt,
forearm, arm, and dumbbells of 6 participants and determine if they are performing
perform barbell lifts correctly or incorrectly.



## Description of Data

Data for this experiment is sourced from the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) project
at http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of
the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front
(Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).



## Data gathering

```r
library(caret)
library(splines)
library(parallel)
library(plyr)
require(RCurl)
```

Fetch data from Human Activity Recognition project

```r
trainingdata <- getURL("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv")
pml_training  <- read.csv(text =trainingdata, header=TRUE, sep=",",na.strings=c("NA",""))
```

### Remove the first column of each row,  the first column that represents a ID Row
```r
pml_training <- pml_training[,-1] 
```


## create training and validating data sets

```r
alltrain = createDataPartition(pml_training$classe,p=0.80, list=FALSE)
training = pml_training[alltrain,]
crossvalidating = pml_training[-allTrain,]
```

## create testing data sets
```r
testcsv <- getURL("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv")
dftestdata <- as.data.frame(read.csv(textConnection(testcsv)))
```


# Data preparation:

The data from the HAR project consists of a training set and a test set. The training set is made up of 160 variables and 15,699 observations while the testing set consists of 160 variables and 20 observations or
prediction instances. 

Review of the training and test data sets reveals multiple columns with NA’s. These columns have been removed since they would offer no
value to the model and prediction.  

## Remove non-relevant data: 
remove columns without data
```r
Keep <-c((colSums(!is.na(training[,-ncol(training)])) >= 0.6*nrow(training)))
training   <- training[,Keep]
crossvalidating <-crossvalidating[,Keep]
```

# Boost GBM model


Using training data, a model is created using GBM (generalized boosted regression model) package. The results are summarized below.

```r
control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=10)
model_gbm <- train(classe~. , data = training , method="gbm" , trControl=control ,  verbose = FALSE )
model_gbm$finalModel
```

### A gradient boosted model with multinomial loss function.
### 150 iterations were performed.
### There were 52 predictors of which 44 had non-zero influence.



## Visualizationof Model Variables



The model variables and their relative importance are indicated below. Based on the importance analysis, the model performance could have been further enhanced by deselecting the variables with no explanatory power. Note also that out of the 53 input variables, ~10% have an importance >20 suggesting significant prospect for further enhancement.

```r
# Visualization
plot(varImp(model_gbm))
```



# Cross Validation and Predicted Error

The BOOST gbm algorithm was conducted with a 10-fold crossvalidation. The data and plot below shows an achieved accuracy on the 3rd
iteration of 96.69% rising from an initial accuracy of 84.11% in teh first iteration.
```r

##Validation Accuracy

Model accuracy and error were further estimated by randomly splitting 20% of the training data prior to model construction.
The below confusion matrix shows the estimated accuracy to be 99.64%.
