# Human Activity Recognition

## Executive Summary

The purpose of the report is to describe the methodology used to produce a model that was
then applied to the training results of group of 20 individuals that resulted
in 100% success of predicting the training class used by each participant.
Applied machine learning techniques In R programming and gbm (generalized
boosted regression model) algorithm were used.

Model accuracy and estimated error was calculated in two ways: a 20% validation data 
split and a k-fold cross validation where k = 10. K-fold cross validation was
.9621 while the validation set was predicted at a rate of .9609.

## Description of Experiment

Using devices
such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a
large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. This
purpose of this experiment is to use data from accelerometers on the belt,
forearm, arm, and dumbbells of 6 participants and determine if they are performing
perform barbell lifts correctly or incorrectly.



## Description of Data

Data for this experiment is sourced from the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) project
atÂ http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of
the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front
(Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).
